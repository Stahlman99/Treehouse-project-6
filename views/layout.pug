              i "Nerd: One who's unbridled passion for something, or things, defines who they are as a person, 
              i without fear of other people's judgement."
              | - Zachary Levi. I love this quote, because it is the
              | best description of myself that I have ever heard! I have spent my life learning, learning more, and
              | then spewing my newfound knowledge upon unsuspecting people (usually my poor parents and siblings).
              | I love traveling, being involved with my church, video games, and pretty much everything else I
              | can think of to do. My biggest passion is development, and I am trying to make a career of it!

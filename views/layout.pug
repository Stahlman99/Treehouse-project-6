              | - Zachary Levi. I love this quote because that is the
              | best descriptions of myself I have ever heard! I have spent my life learning, learning more, and
              | then spewing my newfound knowledge upon unsuspecting people (usually my poor parents and siblings).
              | I love traveling, being involved with my church, video games, and pretty much everything else you
              | can think of. My biggest passion is web development, and I am trying to make a career of it!
